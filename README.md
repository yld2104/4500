Programming Assignments

HW 1 & HW 2
Implementation of linear program to look for arbitrage given multiple scenerios. Analysis performed by seeing how the optimal solution performs under conditions where scenerios change by +- U(-.5, .5). One implementation is in python and another is in C++.

HW 3
Implementation of simple coordinate descent as well as first order gradient descent.
